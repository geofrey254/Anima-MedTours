                        <p class="about-p">At Anima MedTours (AMT), we help patients experience top-quality healthcare
                            in
                            India. We
                            support our patients in their journey to access medical treatment, procedures or routine
                            medical
                            check-ups in India.
                            We advise our patients about the process, provide them with accurate treatment quotes from
                            desired
                            facilities, and ensure they have a seamless experience throughout the treatment and recovery
                            process. After their treatment and return back home, we follow-up to ensure they continue
                            their
                            recovery process based on the treating doctor’s prescription/recommendation.

                        <p class="about-p">At AMT, we understand that the treatment process in a foreign country can be
                            daunting for first-time or even repeat patients.
                            AMT’s primary concern is the patient and their family’s peace of mind. We focus on the
                            logistics
                            and administrative tasks allowing our patients to focus entirely on treatment and recovery.
                            By
                            carrying this burden for them, we ensure that the treatment progresses much more
                            effectively,
                            quickly and with higher chances of successful outcomes.

                <p class="activities-p">AMT maintains a competitive advantage over its competitors by leveraging its
                    network of local partners to ensure that we can offer our clients the best service in the market. We
                    strive to establish strong working relationships with our clients, following up and accompanying
                    them before, during and after their treatment process. This strategy would allow us to attract
                    client loyalty and improve our future engagements with potential clients through personal
                    recommendations.
                    In Kenya, AMT will establish and maintain reliable relationships with a wide network of medical
                    practitioners who are able to recommend our services to their patients. This would be a win-win
                    outcome for all parties involved: the patients access the much-needed support, the referring medical
                    practitioners are better assured that their patients would access quality medical care and return to
                    their care as quickly and effectively as possible.
